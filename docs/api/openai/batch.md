# Batch
Create large batches of API requests for asynchronous processing. The Batch API returns completions within 24 hours for a 50% discount.

## 1. Create batch
postvhttps://api.openai.com/v1/batches
Creates and executes a batch from an uploaded file of requests

### Request body
completion_window string Required
The time frame within which the batch should be processed. Currently only 24h is supported.

endpoint string Required
The endpoint to be used for all requests in the batch. Currently /v1/responses, /v1/chat/completions, /v1/embeddings, and /v1/completions are supported. Note that /v1/embeddings batches are also restricted to a maximum of 50,000 embedding inputs across all requests in the batch.

input_file_id string Required
The ID of an uploaded file that contains requests for the new batch.

See upload file for how to upload a file.
https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/files/create

Your input file must be formatted as a JSONL file, and must be uploaded with the purpose batch. The file can contain up to 50,000 requests, and can be up to 200 MB in size.
https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/batch/request-input

metadata map Optional
Set of 16 key-value pairs that can be attached to an object. This can be useful for storing additional information about the object in a structured format, and querying for objects via API or the dashboard.

Keys are strings with a maximum length of 64 characters. Values are strings with a maximum length of 512 characters.

### Returns
The created Batch object.

### Example request
```python
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI()

client.batches.create(
  input_file_id="file-abc123",
