# Project Intelligence

## Key Implementation Paths

-   `gemini_main.py` is the main script for running the experiment with Gemini models.
-   `claude_check_model.py` and `gemini_check_model.py` are used to check the availability of the models.
-   `parameters.py` defines the personas, texts, models, and experiment parameters.

## Project-Specific Patterns

-   The project uses a modular architecture with separate scripts for each LLM.
-   The prompts used for the LLMs are in Japanese.
-   The experiment results are saved to separate directories for each LLM (e.g., `results_gemini`).

## Known Challenges

-   API rate limits and costs may be a constraint when running the experiment.
-   The availability of the LLM models may vary.

## Tool Usage Patterns

-   `read_file` is used to read the contents of the existing files.
-   `write_to_file` is used to create and update the memory bank files and the `.clinerules` file.
