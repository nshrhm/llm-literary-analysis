# LLM Literary Analysis

This research project evaluates the literary comprehension capabilities of various Large Language Models (LLMs). The project analyzes how well AI models can appreciate and interpret literary works.

## Project Overview

The project currently supports the following LLM models:
- Google Gemini
- (Future planned support for OpenAI, Claude, GitHub Copilot, Deepseek, Grok)

## Features

- Systematic evaluation of LLM's literary analysis capabilities
- Support for multiple LLM models
- Detailed performance metrics and analysis
- Comparative analysis across different models

## Requirements

- Python 3.12
- google-generativeai
- (Additional requirements will be added as more models are supported)
