# Progress

## What Works

- Project structure and configuration files are set up
- Common parameters defined in `parameters.py` (personas, texts, models)
- Model availability checkers implemented (`*_check_model.py`)
- Example scripts for both Claude and Gemini
- Full experiment implementation for Gemini models (`gemini_main.py`)
- Completed initial experiments with all personas and texts using Gemini models
- Results organization system with versioned directories
- Memory bank and `.clinerules` documentation with detailed patterns

## What's Left

- Process and analyze gathered experimental data
- Implement full experiment script for Claude models
- Create comparative analysis tools for cross-model evaluation
- Add documentation for usage and example commands
- Document insights from initial Gemini experiments

## Current Status

The project has successfully completed initial experiments with Gemini models across all personas and texts. Results are organized in versioned directories (`01_results_gemini/`) and current working directory (`results_gemini/`). The basic infrastructure for Claude integration exists but needs to be expanded.

## Known Issues

- API rate limits and costs need to be managed carefully
- Model availability varies and needs to be checked before running experiments
- Results comparison across different model versions requires careful organization
