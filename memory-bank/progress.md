# Project Progress

## 2025/03/22: OpenAI Batch Processing Implementation

### Completed
1. Core Implementation
   - Batch request generation
   - Status monitoring
   - Result processing
   - Error handling

2. Model Support
   - Standard models (gpt-4o, gpt-4o-mini)
   - Limited models (o3-mini, o1-mini)
   - Model-specific adaptations

3. Documentation
   - API usage guidelines
   - Error handling patterns
   - Implementation notes

### Results
1. Performance
   - 48 requests processed successfully
   - 50% cost reduction achieved
   - Error recovery working as expected

2. Model-Specific Handling
   - o3-mini: temperature parameter issue resolved
   - o1-mini: system role message issue resolved
   - Standard models: working as expected

3. Documentation
   - .clinerules/batch-processing.md created
   - .clinerules/error-handling.md created
   - memory-bank updates completed
   - Development docs organized

### Learned
1. Technical Insights
   - Model-specific limitations require flexible design
   - Batch processing reduces costs but increases complexity
   - Error handling is critical for reliability

2. Implementation Patterns
   - Dynamic request formatting
   - Status monitoring with backoff
   - Multi-format result handling

3. Best Practices
   - Validate model capabilities
   - Implement proper error recovery
   - Maintain consistent result formats

### Next Steps
1. Claude Implementation
   - Apply learned patterns
   - Adapt to Claude's batch API
   - Implement model-specific handling

2. Gemini Implementation
   - Research Vertex AI batch prediction
   - Design similar patterns
   - Consider cloud integration

3. Grok Implementation
   - Investigate batch capabilities
   - Apply existing patterns
   - Optimize for X.AI platform

### Issues & Considerations
