# Progress

## What Works

- Project structure and configuration files are set up
- Common parameters defined in `parameters.py` (personas, texts, models)
- Model availability checkers implemented (`*_check_model.py`)
- Example scripts for Gemini, Claude, and Grok
- Full experiment implementation for all models in unified `experiment_runner.py`
- Initial experiments completed with Gemini and Grok models
- Results organization system with versioned directories
- Memory bank and `.clinerules` documentation with detailed patterns

## What's Left

- Complete full experiments with Claude models
- Process and analyze gathered experimental data
- Create comparative analysis tools for three-way model evaluation
- Add documentation for usage and example commands
- Document insights from initial experiments with all models

## Current Status

The project has successfully completed initial experiments with Gemini and Grok models across all personas and texts. Results are organized in versioned directories (`results/{llm}/`) with separate subdirectories for each model type. The basic infrastructure for Claude integration exists and is ready for full-scale experiments.

## Known Issues

- API rate limits and costs need to be managed carefully
- Model availability varies and needs to be checked before running experiments
- Results comparison across different model versions requires careful organization
