# Progress

## What Works

- Project structure and configuration files are set up
- Common parameters defined in `parameters.py` (personas, texts, models)
- Unified model availability checker implemented (`check_models.py`)
- Standardized example scripts for all LLMs:
  - Gemini: `gemini_example.py`
  - Claude: `claude_example.py`
  - Grok: `grok_example.py`
  - OpenAI: `openai_example.py`
- Full experiment implementation for all models in unified `experiment_runner.py`
- Model-specific runners with proper temperature handling
- Initial experiments completed with all models
- Results organization system with model-specific directories
- Memory bank and `.clinerules` documentation with detailed patterns

## What's Left

- Complete comprehensive experiments with all model combinations
- Process and analyze gathered experimental data
- Create comparative analysis tools for four-way model evaluation
- Investigate performance differences between:
  - Temperature-sensitive vs insensitive models
  - Standard vs reasoning-focused models
- Document insights from cross-model experiments

## Current Status

The project has successfully integrated all four LLM platforms (Gemini, Claude, Grok, OpenAI) with a unified experiment runner architecture. Results are organized in model-specific directories (`results/{llm}/`) with appropriate naming conventions. The infrastructure supports both standard temperature-based models and specialized models like OpenAI's reasoning types.

## Known Issues

- API rate limits and costs need to be managed carefully
- Model availability varies and needs to be checked before running experiments
- Results comparison across different model versions requires careful organization
- Temperature handling varies by model type:
  - Standard models use consistent temperature settings
  - OpenAI reasoning models don't use temperature
  - Model-specific optimal temperature ranges may differ
