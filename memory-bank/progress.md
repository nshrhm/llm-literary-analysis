# Progress

## What Works

- Project structure and configuration files are set up
- Common parameters defined in `parameters.py` (personas, texts, models)
- Model availability checkers implemented (`*_check_model.py`)
- Example scripts for both Claude and Gemini
- Full experiment implementation for Gemini models (`gemini_main.py`)
- Memory bank and `.clinerules` have been set up with detailed documentation

## What's Left

- Implement full experiment script for Claude models
- Add support for additional LLM providers
- Implement comparative analysis tools
- Add documentation for usage and example commands

## Current Status

The project is functional for running experiments with Gemini models. The basic infrastructure for Claude integration exists but needs to be expanded.

## Known Issues

- API rate limits and costs need to be managed carefully
- Model availability varies and needs to be checked before running experiments
