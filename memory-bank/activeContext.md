# Active Context

## Current Focus

The project is currently focused on:
- Running experiments with Gemini models through `gemini_main.py`
- Processing and analyzing results from completed experiments
- Evaluating emotional analysis capabilities across different personas and texts

## Recent Changes

- Memory bank and `.clinerules` have been updated with detailed results organization
- Completed initial experiment runs for all personas and texts with Gemini models
- Implemented versioned results directory structure (`01_results_gemini/`)
- Documented file naming conventions and experiment parameters

## Next Steps

- Process and analyze the gathered experimental data
- Implement full experiment script for Claude models
- Create comparative analysis tools to evaluate results across models
- Document insights and patterns from initial Gemini experiments
