# Project Brief

## Overview

This project involves literary analysis using multiple large language models (LLMs), comparing and evaluating the capabilities of Gemini, Claude, Grok, and OpenAI models. The project specifically focuses on emotional analysis in Japanese literary texts, with different model types including both general-purpose and reasoning-focused models.

## Goals

- Evaluate and compare the literary comprehension capabilities across multiple LLM platforms:
  - Google's Gemini models (2.0/1.5シリーズ、Gemma)
  - Anthropic's Claude models (3.7/3.5/3.0シリーズ)
  - X.AI's Grok models (2.0シリーズ)
  - OpenAI's models (text-generation/reasoningタイプ)
- Analyze the models' ability to identify and quantify emotions in literary texts
- Compare performance characteristics between:
  - Different model versions within each platform
  - Temperature-sensitive vs temperature-insensitive models
  - Standard vs reasoning-focused models
- Identify the strengths and weaknesses of each platform in Japanese literary analysis
- Establish benchmarks for emotional analysis capabilities across different LLM architectures
